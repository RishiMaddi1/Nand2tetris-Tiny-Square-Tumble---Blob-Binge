# Project Title: Tiny Square Tumble - Blob Binge
Authors - Rishi Dhaneswar


Welcome to Square vs Blob! This game is an exciting and challenging journey where you control a square and try to touch a blob. Each time the square touches the blob, the square gets smaller. The game gets progressively harder with each touch.

Game Concept
Square: You control a square that moves like in the classic snake game.
Blob: A blob moves around the screen.
Objective: Touch the blob 15 times until the square and the blob are the same size.
Challenge: The blob moves very fast, and the square reduces in size with each touch, making it harder to hit the blob.
How to Play
Control the Square: Use arrow keys to move the square.
Touch the Blob: Each time the square touches the blob, it reduces in size.
Repeat: Keep touching the blob until the square is the same size as the blob.
Levels: The game has 10 difficulty levels, with the blob moving faster at each level.
